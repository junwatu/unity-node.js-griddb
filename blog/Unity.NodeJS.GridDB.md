# Unity, Node.js, and GridDB: Real-time Game Progress Synchronization

## Introduction

As players engage with a game, every action, decision, and game state change is a piece of valuable data. Saving this data accurately and promptly is pivotal for a seamless gaming experience, especially in multiplayer scenarios or games that require consistent syncing.

## **The Building Blocks: Unity, Node.js, and GridDB**

We will build a simple game using [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine with the backend [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [GridDB](https://www.griddb.net/) database. Let's unravel the significance of each:

- **Unity:** Unity is a top game development platform with a versatile engine for crafting 2D sprites and 3D worlds. The platform has a user-friendly interface, a rich array of assets, and a supportive community to help create immersive gaming experiences for mobile devices, desktops, and VR headsets.

- **Node.js:** It allows developers to create efficient and scalable backend services using JavaScript, a language mostly recognized for web-based applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is ideal for handling numerous simultaneous connections, making it perfect for games with a large user base. It acts as a bridge, connecting Unity games to databases such as GridDB.

- **GridDB:** In real-time gaming, efficient data storage is crucial. GridDB is a highly scalable, available, and durable database system designed for this purpose. Its architecture is tailored for IoT use-cases, translating well into gaming, ensuring every player action is captured and stored with low latency.
